I am an engineer, who works on understanding difficult concepts and putting them in simple words to make people excited about cool projects.

Currently I work as a part-time math teacher at Russian School of Mathematics. I fell in love with school's teaching approach; teaching students how to think by having a logical approach to the problems they have never seen before. In addition to teaching, I use my computer science background to break into the world of data science.

My American life started few years ago when my mother and I moved to United States from Russia. I received my BS degree from Umass Amherst in Computer Systems Engineering. After school, I had a privilege to work in one of the most recognizable financial companies - S&P Global Platts. There, I participated in major agile software development transformation, AWS cloud server migration, and acquired interest in data analytics and machine learning.

2019 was a year of new opportunities: I left my company to visit my family in Russia and help my father with PVC extrusion manufacturing. Furthermore, I deepened my knowledge in web scraping, data science, data visualization, and neuroscience.
