Being inspired by current achievements of deep learning in healthcare diagnostics, I decided to apply my machine learning skills and built [MRI brain tumor detector](https://www.kaggle.com/yburdin/brain-mri-test).


Golf Course Web Scraping
-----

While researching on data, I've came across [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) and his deeds. I got captivated by the ideas that he carried out to the public and started learning data scraping, data processing and data visualizing tools and techniques. 

I've [scraped golf course data](https://github.com/yar-bur/Golf-Course-Spider.git), built a data model and used Tableau to visualize my findings.

On-Board System for Driving Style Assesment
-----
For my senior design project my team and I decided to build [the system](/files/poster.pdf) that would be capable of detecting aggresive driving behavior with further notification of the driver or parents (in cases, where the system was used as a parental control system) by email or text messaging.

I was responsible for the driving style assessment using [accelerometer data](/files/PDR_Presentation_team25_acc.pdf). I used k-means clustering method to categorize actions: speeding, sharp turns, break slamming.
